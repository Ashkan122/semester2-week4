# Command line arguments and dynamic memory allocation



1. **Using atoi() and atof()**



The program cmd\_line\_data.c is designed to accept 3 command line arguments of different type.

Add code to properly handle the specified data types.

Implement a solution in Python and compare the code.



2. **Vector and matrix operations**



Considering the examples from session 1 of this week choose one vector and one matrix task
and modify the examples to use a command line argument that sets the size of the vector and matrix.

There are two example solutions provided in the repository for this session that you can use if you wish.
